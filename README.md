# LimitVis
A game about limited sight

## Notes
- Alice's laptop died during the last week so she borrowed a friend's laptop, which is why you might see commits from "Zak Dasaro" 

## Languages/Tools
- Javascript
- ThreeJS
- WebGL

## Timeline
**April 29 - May 5**
- Basic scene and rendering pipeline set up
    - floor/background
    - obstacles (must determine what they are)
        - spikes?
        - traps?
        - rocks?

**May 6 - May 9**
- Light tracking
- Possible particle detection for fog
    - this will need to be only in the players vicinity otherwise the
      rendering time may take too long
- Monster tracking
    - primitive tracking (monster does not have to avoid obstacles)

**May 10 - May 13**
- Collision detection
- Fix other errors

**May 14**
Dean's Date. Project Due date.

## Features
- Partial particle detection with fog (this can be an addon??)
- Monster tracking (does the player physically interact with the monster)
- Light/camera should track player

## Objects in scene
- Mostly primitives (cubes, triangles)
